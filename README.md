#Merge Sort programming project

* This is a programming project from the book Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach
* // Write a program that reads a series of input lines and sorts them into alphabetical order, ignoring the case of words. The program should use the merge sort algorithm so that it efficiently sorts even a large file.

# Important Note
* I am a student so please do not copy this program and expect to work as your professor wants it to. I am simply doing this out of curiosity and to improve my skills.
